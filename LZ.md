I have some questions on LZ optimality. 

1. LZ77 proof (where we use the fact that we dont stop the matching?)
2. LZ-End analysis
3. LZ with fixed window length (or any algorithm per se)
4. What should be the rate of increase of window?
5. LZ with initial window (and not the previous context)
6. LZ and random addition
7. LZ and random access
