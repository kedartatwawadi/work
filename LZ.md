I have some questions on LZ optimality. 

1. LZ77 proof (where we use the fact that we dont stop the matching?)
2. LZ-End analysis
3. LZ with fixed window length (or any algorithm per se)
4. What should be the rate of increase of window?
5. LZ with initial window (and not the previous context)
6. LZ and random addition
7. LZ and random access


1. LZ77 Original: 
2. LZ77 Over 2D Data: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1057132/?arnumber=1057132&tag=1
3. LZ77 Individual Sequence: 
4. LZ77 with fixed window: 
5. LZ77 with increasing window:
8.
