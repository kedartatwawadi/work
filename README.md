## LZ
1. BWT
2. Theoretical Justification for BWT
3. Understand the existing LZ77 works for finite sequences?  
4. Different variants of LZ77

## Video Compression
Experiment on the Video Compression part (Neural Networks)
1. Tensorflow
2. Experiment with the Google compressor
3. Difference/LZ on the residual values/ arbitrary loss functions etc.
